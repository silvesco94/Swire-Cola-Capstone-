# Swire-Cola-Capstone-
Predictive Maintenance model for Swire Coca-Cola

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance solution for Swire Coca-Cola to minimize unplanned machine downtimes. Leveraging survival analysis and machine learning models, the solution aims to forecast machinery failures, enabling proactive repairs, cost savings, and enhanced operational efficiency.

## [Business Problem](Business%20Problem%20Statement.pdf)

Swire Coca-Colaâ€™s production plants face significant challenges with unplanned equipment breakdowns, resulting in production shortfalls and an estimated $60 million annual loss. The current reactive maintenance strategy leads to delayed repairs, increased costs, and reduced production efficiency.


## [Solution](Group%20Modeling%20Assignment.html)

To address these challenges, a predictive maintenance system was developed. This system incorporates:
- **Survival Analysis**: To estimate the likelihood of machine failures over time and predict high-risk periods.
- **Random Forest Models**: To identify key features influencing breakdowns and generate highly accurate predictions.
- **Logistic Regression**: To predict probabilities of equipment failure under specific conditions.

These models provide actionable insights to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce costs, and improve production continuity.

## [Business Value](https://github.com/silvesco94/repository-name/blob/main/Swire%20Coca-Cola%20Capstone.pdf)
This solution delivers:
1. **Proactive Maintenance Planning**:
   - Reduces unplanned downtimes by identifying high-risk machinery.
   - Improves repair efficiency and resource allocation.
2. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Keeps production running smoothly, reducing disruptions.
   - Meets customer demands through consistent production schedules.
3. **Cost Savings**:
   - Aims to cut downtime-related losses by at least 50%, saving Swire Coca-Cola millions annually.


## Challenges
The project encountered several challenges:
- Over 80% of missing equipment IDs, reducing model granularity at the machine level.
- Imbalanced breakdown data, requiring careful handling to avoid overfitting.
- Inconsistent date fields, necessitating extensive preprocessing for accurate analysis.

## [Contributions](https://github.com/silvesco94/repository-name/blob/main/Seasonal%20Random%20Forest.html)
This project provided an opportunity to:
- Handle real-world messy data, learning essential preprocessing techniques.
- Conduct a random forest model to see seasonal effects of broken-down machines.
- Frame and execute research to align with business goals while balancing technical rigor and stakeholder concerns.
